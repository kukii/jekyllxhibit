_Disclaimer - this is not intended to be a stab at Newby's practice, I am a huge fan of her work_

One key thing which was discussed with Dan Arps in regards to my project was what it means to copy/re-interpret someone's work. In my case I am a small fry re-interpreting the work of "bigger" artists. Therefore, there is an ethical dimension to my project, one that is essentially a power play between an established artist and a nobody. It is up to me how I respond to each of these works; it could be done in homage of it or as a way of critique.

Like Kate Newby, an artist who takes the logic of two things (humour and seriousness) and puts it together, this is also another angle of exploration. To bring something new to the discussion I need to add something to my versions, to step them up essentially.

Current artists of interest are Bruce Nauman, Vito Acconci, Ronnie Van Hoult, JJ Xi and Cai Yuan.
